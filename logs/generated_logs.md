## Find All Log Files in Logs Folder

- Once you start running the clairvoyant_[x-x].py scrypt, these logs will be saved within a subfolder for each run. (e.g, run_20251020_144838).
- The scrypt is set to only keep the most recent three runs, deleting the oldest (3rd) run when a new run is started.
- So make sure to save any of the subfolders generated within the logs folder that you would like to keep for longer than 3 runs.
